# Ecommerce Solidity Contract

This Solidity contract represents a basic ecommerce system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contract Overview

The Ecommerce contract facilitates listing items for sale and allowing users to make purchases. It includes the following features:

- Listing items with details such as name, category, image, cost, rating, stock, and description.
- Allowing users to buy items by providing the item ID and appropriate payment.
- Keeping track of orders placed by users.
- Allowing the contract owner to withdraw the contract's balance.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

To interact with the contract, you'll need the following:

- An Ethereum development environment or an Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask.
- The contract address after deploying it to an Ethereum network.
- The contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface).

### Interacting with the Contract

1. Connect to the Ethereum network: Configure your Ethereum development environment or wallet to connect to the desired Ethereum network (e.g., mainnet, testnet, or a local development network).

2. Access the contract: Use your Ethereum development environment or wallet to navigate to the contract interaction section.

3. Enter the contract address and ABI: Provide the contract address and its ABI to your Ethereum development environment or wallet to enable interaction with the contract.

4. Choose a function to execute: Select the desired function from the available functions provided by the contract. Refer to the contract's function descriptions for details on their purpose and required parameters.

5. Provide input parameters: If the chosen function requires input parameters, enter the appropriate values for those parameters. Ensure the values adhere to the specified data types and formats.

6. Execute the function: Trigger the execution of the chosen function by clicking on the execution button or option provided by your Ethereum development environment or wallet.

7. Handle the output: If the executed function returns any values, your Ethereum development environment or wallet will provide the output or result of the function call. Capture and use the output as required in your application or further interactions with the contract.

## Contract Functions

The following functions are available in the Ecommerce contract:
